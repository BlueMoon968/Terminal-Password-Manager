# Terminal-Password-Manager
I have created a password manager for my personal use in Python. It just reads/save data inside a JSON file.
It uses only default Python dependencies:
- os
- socket
- json 
- time

## How to excute
Open a terminal instance inside the code directory and type:
```shell
python main.py
```
